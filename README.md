# Skynet-Security-System

2nd year internet of things project for the module: IoT Standards and Protocols.
###  My goal for this project is to create an affordable solution to home security.
Created a home security system making use of low-cost ESP32 IP programmed using the Arduino IDE to act as a video webserver on the local network. I repurposed an old laptop by installing an image of Ubuntu lite and created a server to relay local webcam streams to a globally accessible server
Using several ESP32 camera modules and a Raspberry pi connected to the network, I configured a webserver using the hardware of a HP office laptop from 2015.


This machine is running an Intel core i7-4510U dual core CPU with an additional 8gb memory module salvaged from a different laptop
in total the machine has 16gb of DDR3 memory. For storage the original 1TB hard drive was taken out and replaced with a 250GB SSD.
I decided to give old hardaware a second life as it is much more powerful than my Raspberry pi 4(8gb)
